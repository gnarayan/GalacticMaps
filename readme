SNe, GRBs, and Pulsars!

- test with other browsers
 - Safari: scroll to about goes too far (fkit, leave it be for now.  Looks like window.scroll doesn't work!?)
   Firefox: look into lack of gradient (fkit, just let them be coreless. Looks like the opacity gradient doesn't work.)

Quick way to run:
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
